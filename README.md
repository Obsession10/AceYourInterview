  How the user interacts with the app: the user logs in and he wanna practice his theoretycal skills needed for pass an interview: on main page there are all the listed domains and the user choose which one he wanna practice or maybe he wanna practice all of them together. 
  For every domain, we'll have a set of questions prepared, a time for every quesiton, and a set of answers from which the user has to choose one correct. 
  At the end of the questions (let's say 5 for every domain) the user will receive a score for the domain, score memorised in his board.
  In interview mode, therre will be more sections, like: FrontEnd dev, Backend dev and mock interview mode (where the users can interview each other, one of them will be the interviewer and will ask/choose questions based on the roadmap created by the application).
  Back to main, the user will have a dashboard where he will find his all-time score at every domain + interview/mock interview.
  
  Va trebui creat un API care preia din mai multe locuri intrebari/raspunsuri specifice pentru un anume domeniu, cam cate 50/100 intrebari si 4 variante de raspuns pentru fiecare.
  Aceste intrebari si raspunsuri vor trebui stocate in baza de date a aplicatiei, toate fiind aceleasi pentru toti userii.
